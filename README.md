### 📦 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.

Features:

---

### ⚠️ `npm run eject`

> **Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

This command:

- Removes the single build dependency
- Copies configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project
- Gives you full control over configuration

All commands except `eject` will continue to work after ejecting.

You usually **do NOT need to eject** unless you need deep customization.
